# Tomato Juice

## Overview

## Examples

Within the examples package, you can find two examples (`TrainingExample.java` and `TrainingExample2.java`). 

### `TrainingExample.java`

This example contains a full-run through of our logistic regression training algorithm including
* setting up sample parameters for training including sample data
* training (logistic regression)
* testing the results of the algorithm on test data

### `TrainingExample2.java`

This example is similar to the one above only it reads data from a file (`observations.tsv`) rather than generating data.
