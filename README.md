# Tomato Juice

## Overview

Tomato Juice is a simple and efficient Machine Learning library for training Logistic Regression models on sparse data with rare events.

## Examples

For a guided walk-through of how to use the library, you can check out the examples package. Within the examples package, you can find two examples (`LogisticRegressionWithGeneratedData.java` and `LogisticRegressionWithDataFromFile.java`). 

### `LogisticRegressionWithGeneratedData.java`

This example contains a full-run through of our logistic regression algorithm including
* setting up sample parameters for training including input data
* training (logistic regression)
* evaluating the performance of the training results on test data

### `LogisticRegressionWithDataFromFile.java`

This example is similar to the one above only it reads data from a file (`observations.tsv`) rather than generating data.
